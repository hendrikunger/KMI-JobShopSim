# KMI-JobShopSim
**Gym Simulation Environment for Job Shop Problems using Salabim**

*currently in progress*
Goal: provide a flexibel interface to design simulation environments for manufacturing systems which can be easily integrated in reinforcement learning workflows and provides a convenient way to conduct differing experiments

Additional information is provided at later project-stages.
